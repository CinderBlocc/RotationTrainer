Welcome to RotationTrainer's user generated sequences! This guide should explain everything you need to know.

A line that starts with this symbol '#' is a comment and will be skipped by the file parser.
A description of any line length can go up top, above the "begin properties" or "begin sequence" commands.
These description lines do not need the comment marker. Only lines after "begin properties/sequence" need it.

To specify properties, add a "begin properties" line before the sequence.
Properties options (capitalization doesn't matter):
    - NO BALL: By default, scoring the ball is automatically added as the last checkpoint. Use this property to disable that.
    - BOOST START <value>: Set the starting boost amount (int, 0-100).
    - BOOST MAX <value>: Set the maximum boost amount during the sequence (int, 0-100).
    - POSITION <x> <y> <z>: Set the starting position of the car.
    - ROTATION <pitch> <yaw> <roll>: Set the starting rotation of the car (in degrees).

You can use button in the UI to get the current location/rotation properties of your car in freeplay.
Clicking that will copy the values to your clipboard, which you can then paste in a config.

To create a single sequence, add a "begin sequence" line.
You can either use the preset list of checkpoints, or create a custom checkpoint.
	- For the preset list, refer to "RotationTrainerCodeLocations/Names" in the folder above.
	- For a custom checkpoint, these two options are available:
		- CUSTOM(X, Y, Z) RADIUS(float) BOOSTSET(int, 0-100) NAME(string)
			- RADIUS, BOOSTSET, and NAME are optional and can be listed in any order
		- DEMOCAR(X, Y, Z) ROTATION(P, Y, R) NAME(string)
			- ROTATION is optional and should be provided in degrees
			- NAME is also optional

To create a nested sequence (or a playlist), add a "begin sequence list" line.
Below that line you can list any of the filenames of other sequences. Do not include ".cfg".
	- Refer to "_ExampleNested.cfg" to see this in action

You cannot mix checkpoints with nested sequences. A config is EITHER a list of checkpoints, or a list of sequences.
Nested sequences also do not use properties, so you can leave those out.
